# Brand Data Hook Optimization Plan

## Current Issue
AbortError occurring in useBrandData hook when aborting fetch requests during component cleanup.

## Root Cause
- Race conditions in cleanup phase
- Potential multiple abort attempts on the same controller
- Insufficient cleanup of refs and state

## Solution Steps

1. Improve AbortController Management
   - Add additional safety checks before aborting
   - Clear the controller reference after aborting
   - Ensure proper cleanup timing

2. Enhance State Management
   - Add proper cleanup of all refs in unmount phase
   - Improve state synchronization
   - Add safeguards against state updates after unmount

3. Implementation Details
   ```typescript
   // Cleanup function improvements
   if (abortControllerRef.current?.signal && !abortControllerRef.current.signal.aborted) {
     abortControllerRef.current.abort();
     abortControllerRef.current = null; // Clear reference after aborting
   }
   ```

4. Testing Considerations
   - Test component mount/unmount scenarios
   - Verify cleanup with multiple brand switches
   - Ensure no memory leaks
   - Validate state consistency

## Expected Outcome
- Elimination of AbortError during cleanup
- Improved component lifecycle management
- Better memory management
- More stable brand data loading
